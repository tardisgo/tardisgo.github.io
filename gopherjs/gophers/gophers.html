Above is the <a href="http://tardisgo.github.io">TARDIS Go</a> front page example re-written by 
<a href="https://github.com/elliott5">Elliott</a> to work with <a href="http://gopherjs.org">GopherJS</a>, 
a project that sets the benchmark for Go implementations into JS. The project's author, Richard Musiol, 
and his many open-source contributors are to be congratulated.
</p>

<p>
At 8.5k, the GopherJS version of the
<a href="https://github.com/tardisgo/tardisgo.github.io/blob/master/gopherjs/gophers/gophers.go">source code</a>
is a similar size to that for TARDIS Go. 
However GopherJS' 148k of minimized JS is only 40% of the 370k TARDIS Go version (as at 6 November 2014). 
</p>

<p>
Why is the TARDIS Go JS version so big? In part because the code is not using the JS/HTML API directly (as the GopherJS version is), but is working through the <a href="http://www.openfl.org">OpenFL</a> "Open Flash" API. While this approach means that the TARDIS Go JS version is larger, for other platforms it has the great advantage that the same code can be used to build binaries for all of the OpenFL targets - desktops, tablets, phones and even games consoles.
